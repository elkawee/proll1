An Experiment with prolog style evaluators and org-babel for literate programming.

./proll1 ( prolog like language 1 ) contains the evaluators implementation in org files.
It until now most of it's ideas are directly from the famous Reasoned Schemer.

./examples follows William F.Clocksin's book Clause and Effect with it's exercises done in both:
standart prolog and the evaluator from ./proll1 to make sure ideomatic prolog stuff has a
behaviour close to the original.

All .org files are set up so that, they tangle to a respective ./src_out folder 
and dump their execution's result directly back into the .org


TODO : 
- take the literate part more seriously
- utilize racket's test framework
- the evaluator is kind of retarded 
  - prolog style meta programming is flat out impossible with this approach 
  - cut and freeze will be hard to implement
  - slow doesn't even begin to describe it
